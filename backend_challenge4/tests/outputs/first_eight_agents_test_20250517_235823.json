Financial Performance & Risk Trends**  \n- **Consistently High Risk:** The company has maintained a **\"High\" risk level** across all three years, with an **average score of 0.158 out of 2.0**, far below acceptable thresholds.  \n- **Deterioration in 2024:** The **total score dropped to 0.075** in 2024, the lowest in the period, driven by negative revenue growth (-0.71) and a **zero-point solvency ratio**.  \n- **Marginal Improvement in 2023:** The 2023 score (0.225) showed slight improvement due to better **net margin (0.28, up from 0.07 in 2022)** and **positive revenue growth (1.59)**, but this was not sustained.  \n\n#### **2. Strengths**  \n- **Adequate Liquidity:** The **general liquidity ratio** remained above 2.0 in all years (peaking at 3.14 in 2022), indicating sufficient short-term asset coverage.  \n- **Solvency Near Threshold (2022–2023):** The **general solvency ratio** was just above 1.0 in 2022–2023, suggesting minimal but positive equity coverage of debt.  \n\n#### **3. Critical Weaknesses**  \n- **Persistent Net Debt Issues:** The **net debt ratio** consistently scored **zero points**, indicating excessive leverage relative to earnings.  \n- **Volatile Profitability:** The **net margin** fluctuated (0.07 in 2022 → 0.28 in 2023 → 0.05 in 2024), reflecting unstable cost management or pricing power.  \n- **Negative Revenue Growth (2024):** A **-0.71 revenue decline** in 2024 raises concerns about market competitiveness or demand erosion.  \n- **Collapse in Solvency (2024):** The solvency ratio fell to **exactly 1.0 (0 points)**, signaling **no buffer for debt repayment**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**  \nTo transition to a **\"Moderate\" or \"Low\" risk** rating, the company must address:  \n\n#### **1. Debt & Solvency Management**  \n- **Reduce Leverage:** Implement aggressive debt repayment plans or refinance high-cost debt.  \n- **Strengthen Equity Base:** Explore equity injections or retained earnings retention to improve solvency.  \n\n#### **2. Profitability & Cost Control**  \n- **Stabilize Net Margins:** Conduct a cost structure review to identify inefficiencies (e.g., SG&A, COGS).  \n- **Pricing Strategy:** Reassess pricing models to align with market conditions and improve margins.  \n\n#### **3. Revenue Growth Strategy**  \n- **Market Expansion/Diversification:** Address the 2024 revenue decline by exploring new markets or product lines.  \n- **Customer Retention:** Enhance sales and marketing efforts to stabilize top-line performance.  \n\n#### **4. Liquidity Preservation**  \n- **Working Capital Optimization:** Tighten receivables/payables cycles to free up cash flow.  \n- **Contingency Reserves:** Maintain higher cash reserves to buffer against further downturns.  \n\n---\n\n### **Auditor’s Conclusion**  \nThe company’s financial health is **unsatisfactory**, with persistent high-risk indicators, declining performance in 2024, and inadequate solvency. **Immediate corrective actions** are required to avoid further deterioration. A **revised audit opinion may be reconsidered** upon demonstrating:  \n- Sustained **revenue growth** and **net margin stability**,  \n- A **net debt reduction** below 1.0, and  \n- A **solvency ratio** consistently above 1.5.  \n\n**Next Steps:** Management should provide a **detailed turnaround plan** within 90 days, focusing on the above priorities. External financing or restructuring may be necessary if internal measures fail.  \n\n---  \n**Prepared by:** [Auditor’s Name]  \n**Date:** [Date]  \n**Firm:** [Audit Firm Name]  \n\n*(This opinion is based solely on the provided financial metrics and risk analysis.)*",

However, the identified risks of construction delays and regulatory approvals are significant, especially in the context of Algeria's regulatory environment. The client has a solid background in real estate and infrastructure, which is a positive factor, but the scale and complexity of this project require further assurance of their capability to navigate these risks effectively. Additionally, while the project aligns with sustainable energy objectives, a more detailed assessment of its Shariah compliance is necessary to ensure it meets all Islamic finance principles. Therefore, I recommend modifications to include a more robust risk management plan and a comprehensive Shariah compliance review.",
