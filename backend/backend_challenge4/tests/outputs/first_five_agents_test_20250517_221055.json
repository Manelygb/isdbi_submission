    "summary": "# **Final Audit Opinion**  \n**Company Name:** [Company Name]  \n**Audit Period:** 2022–2024  \n**Overall Verdict:** **REJECT**  \n\n## **Summary of Findings**  \nBased on a three-year financial audit (2022–2024), the company exhibits **persistent financial weaknesses**, scoring well below acceptable thresholds (average score: **0.158/2.0**) and consistently falling into the **\"High Risk\"** category. Key concerns include poor liquidity, elevated net debt, declining solvency, and inconsistent profitability. While minor improvements were noted in 2023 (e.g., net margin growth), these were offset by worsening trends in 2024, particularly in revenue contraction and solvency.  \n\n### **Key Financial Trends & Risk Analysis**  \n1. **Liquidity Concerns (GENERAL_LIQUIDITY)**  \n   - Liquidity ratios fluctuated (2022: 3.14 → 2024: 2.96) but remained suboptimal, indicating **strained short-term financial flexibility**.  \n   - **Score:** Consistently low (1/2 points annually), suggesting recurring cash flow challenges.  \n\n2. **High Net Debt (NET_DEBT)**  \n   - Net debt levels remained elevated (2022: 2.15 → 2024: 1.12), with **zero points scored** in all years.  \n   - **Implication:** The company is overly reliant on debt financing, increasing refinancing and interest rate risks.  \n\n3. **Deteriorating Solvency (GENERAL_SOLVENCY_RATIO)**  \n   - Solvency marginally improved in 2022–2023 (1.0+), but **dropped to 1.0 in 2024 (0 points)**, signaling **weakening long-term financial stability**.  \n\n4. **Unstable Profitability (NET_MARGIN & REVENUE_GROWTH)**  \n   - Net margin volatility (2022: 7.3% → 2023: 28% → 2024: 5%) suggests **inefficient cost control** or inconsistent revenue streams.  \n   - **Revenue Decline (2024):** -70.7% growth severely impacted financial viability.  \n\n---\n\n## **Audit Conclusion**  \nThe company’s financial health is **unsustainable**, with chronic weaknesses in liquidity, debt management, and profitability. The **\"REJECT\"** verdict reflects:  \n- **High cumulative risk** across all years.  \n- **Negative trend in 2024**, eroding prior marginal gains.  \n- **Insufficient safeguards** against solvency or liquidity crises.  \n\n---\n\n## **Recommendations for Improvement**  \nTo transition toward financial stability, the company must:  \n\n1. **Debt Restructuring**  \n   - Refinance high-cost debt and negotiate longer maturities.  \n   - Target a net debt ratio below 1.0 to reduce leverage risk.  \n\n2. **Cost Optimization & Margin Stabilization**  \n   - Implement rigorous cost controls to sustain net margins above 10%.  \n   - Diversify revenue streams to mitigate volatility.  \n\n3. **Liquidity Management**  \n   - Build cash reserves to cover short-term liabilities (target liquidity ratio >3.5).  \n   - Secure revolving credit facilities for emergency liquidity.  \n\n4. **Strategic Revenue Growth**  \n   - Address the 2024 revenue collapse through market expansion or product diversification.  \n   - Focus on recurring revenue models to reduce cyclical dependence.  \n\n---\n\n## **Final Note**  \nWithout urgent corrective action, the company risks **insolvency or severe operational constraints**. A revised audit may be considered after 12–18 months of implementing the above measures.  \n\n**Signed,**  \n[Your Name]  \nSenior Financial Auditor  \n[Audit Firm Name]  \n[Date]",
