    "content": "Based on the provided scenario and AAOIFI guidelines, here is the complete multi-stage accounting treatment from the lessee's perspective using the Underlying Asset Cost Method for the Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek contract.\n\n### A. Cost & Profit Computations\n\n1. **Total Cost of the Leased Asset**:  \n   - Total Asset Cost = $1,000,000\n\n2. **Right-of-Use (ROU) Asset**:  \n   - Since ownership transfer is highly probable through a gift at the end of the lease term, we do not deduct any purchase-option price.  \n   - ROU Asset = Total Asset Cost = $1,000,000\n\n3. **Total Lease Payments**:  \n   - Total Lease Payments = $1,200,000 (60 months \u00d7 $20,000)\n\n4. **Deferred Ijarah Cost**:  \n   - Deferred Ijarah Cost = Total Lease Payments \u2013 ROU Asset  \n   - Deferred Ijarah Cost = $1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000\n\n5. **Terminal Value Difference**:  \n   - Since the transfer mechanism is a gift, we consider the residual value to be $0.  \n   - Terminal Value Difference = Residual Value \u2013 Purchase Option = $0 - $0 = $0\n\n6. **Amortizable Amount**:  \n   - Amortizable Amount = ROU Asset \u2013 Terminal Value Difference  \n   - Amortizable Amount = $1,000,000 - $0 = $1,000,000\n\n---\n\n### B. Journal Entries\n\n**1. At Lease Commencement:**\n\n```plaintext\nDr. Right-of-Use Asset (ROU)          $1,000,000\nDr. Deferred Ijarah Cost (Expense)    $200,000\nCr. Ijarah Liability                    $1,200,000\n```\n\n**2. Annual Accrual of Rental & Income Recognition:**\n\nFor each year (5 years), the entries will be as follows:\n\n```plaintext\nDr. Accrued Rent Receivable / Bank     $240,000  (Annual Rent: $20,000 \u00d7 12)\nCr. Ijarah Income (P&L)                $240,000\n```\n\n**3. (Optional) Ownership Transfer at End of Lease:**\n\nIf ownership is transferred at the end of the lease:\n\n```plaintext\nDr. Ijarah Liability                    $1,200,000\nCr. Cash / Bank / Other Assets          $1,200,000  (Assuming the gift is recognized as a transfer without cash)\n```\n\n---\n\n### C.
